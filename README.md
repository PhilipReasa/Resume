# Resume
This is a super simple repo. The purpose - watch my resume live and grow.

## About
The resume is a word doc (sorry), because Markdown just isn't powerful enough for a resume IMO.

Because it is a word doc, and who knows how long I will have access to MS Office, or the ability to open older versions, I also keep a shadow PDF. The word doc should be the SOT, but the PDF _should_ be a little more future proof.

## Website
Hopefully, this repo will eventually also come with a github.io website. We will see if it happens

## Contributions
Not that anyone else would contribute... because why would they, but all work will just happen right on master
